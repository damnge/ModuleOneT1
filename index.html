            <p>On Monday the 15th August 2022 Monty was out for a walk with his Dad, Monty had been playing with a stick then it was time to head home, his Dad put him on the lead to cross the roads and onto the next bit of green space where a normally sensible Monty was let off again. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Monty is a timid boy anyway, wary of strangers and a good deal of noises, now he'd also had the traumatic experience of being hit by a car. His Parents, family and friends searched for hours that night, fearing the worst that he was injured or even dead somewhere near to where he was hit.
